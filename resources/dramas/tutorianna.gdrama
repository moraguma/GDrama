<beat Directions>
<unflag asked_directions>
Tutorianna: Well, directions are what you're seeing [wave]right now!
Tutorianna: They're the main building block of GDrama scenes
Tutorianna: Each direction includes an actor name - in my case it's [wave]Tutorianna
Tutorianna: And also a list of steps to that direction
Tutorianna: Each step can be either a [wave]dialogue or a call!
Tutorianna: For instance, I can... <wait 0.5>[wave]wait... <wait 0.5> between... <wait 0.5>words!
Tutorianna: I can also... <wait 0.5><hop Tutorianna>[wave]jump![/wave]<wait 0.5> in the middle of a conversation!
Tutorianna: Or scamper! <scamper Tutorianna><wait 0.5> [wave]La la la la la la!
Tutorianna: <stop_scamper Tutorianna>And a bunch more! <wait 0.5>GDrama is made so you can [wave]create new calls based on the necessities of your game
Tutorianna: As such, directions can be used to handle all sorts of different cutscenes
<jump Questions>

<beat Choices>
<unflag asked_choices>
Tutorianna: Well, you just made a choice, didn't you?
Tutorianna: Choices are used handle different paths through the same scene
Tutorianna: They work just like the one you just saw... [wave]but they also have some secrets!
Tutorianna: For instance, you might notice that questions you can ask me disappear after you've asked them a first time
Tutorianna: That's because choices can also be affected by flags set in and out of a scene!
Tutorianna: There's all sorts of things you can do with implementation of custom dialogue logic...
Tutorianna: An example of this is that if you talk to me a second time...
Tutorianna: [wave]I might say something different!
